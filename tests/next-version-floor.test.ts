/**
 * The `next` version FLOOR across the workspace (#579).
 *
 * `next@16.2.10` shipped with 4 HIGH advisories — CVE-2026-64641 (GHSA-m99w-x7hq-7vfj),
 * CVE-2026-64642 (GHSA-6gpp-xcg3-4w24), CVE-2026-64645 (GHSA-p9j2-gv94-2wf4) and
 * CVE-2026-64649 (GHSA-89xv-2m56-2m9x) — plus 5 MODERATE, all fixed in 16.2.11.
 * Remediation discipline for this repo is BUMP, never suppress (#155/#199/#319/#320/#465).
 *
 * This guard locks the floor so a later `pnpm update`, a new app, or a copy-pasted
 * pin cannot silently walk the tree back under a fixed version. It SCANS the
 * workspace globs rather than enumerating packages — an enumerated list is how the
 * second manifest gets missed, and this repo has hit that twice.
 *
 * Two deliberate exclusions, stated rather than left to be rediscovered:
 *
 *   - `peerDependencies`. `@getknext/core` declares `next: ">=16.0.0"` on purpose:
 *     it is a compatibility statement about what the adapter supports, not a
 *     statement about what we install. Raising it would drop support for every
 *     16.0/16.1 consumer over a CVE in *their* tree, which they fix by upgrading
 *     `next`, not by upgrading knext.
 *   - `NEXTJS_REF` in `.github/workflows/test-e2e-deploy.yml`. That is a different
 *     knob — it is the vercel/next.js git TAG the compat suite is checked out at
 *     (and, via `NEXT_NPM_VERSION="${NEXTJS_REF#v}"`, the prebuilt `next` the
 *     fixtures install). It is inside the compat-window frozen set (ADR-0039), so
 *     moving it is a lead decision about what "green" means, not a security bump.
