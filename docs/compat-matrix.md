## Legend

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | **Supported** — backed by a red-on-fail check (the per-PR `compat-smoke` gate) or test-covered source on disk. |
| ⚠️ | **Partial** — implemented but **not** guarded by a hard correctness check, or with a known caveat (see Notes). Do not rely on it as "verified." |
| ❌ | **Unsupported / unverified** — no working implementation or no evidence; treat as a gap. |
| ⛔ | **Upstream-gated** — architecturally out of reach today (global edge, not yet adapter-standardizable upstream). |

The **Evidence** column cites either a real file path in this repo, or a `compat-smoke` check id
(`a`–`g`) from [`apps/file-manager/scripts/compat-smoke.mjs`](../apps/file-manager/scripts/compat-smoke.mjs),
or the `compat-smoke` CI job in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml). The
`compat-smoke` job runs per-PR on a **Node + Bun** matrix (ADR-0007 / A3-1). It is a knext **smoke**
gate, not the official suite — the official suite has its own row, own workflow
([`test-e2e-deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/test-e2e-deploy.yml)), and a stricter evidence rule
(run ID + pinned ref + result, enforced by the guard test).

## Matrix

| Feature | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| App Router (RSC server render, `GET /` → 200 HTML) | ✅ | smoke a | Hard-asserts 200 + `text/html` + non-trivial body against the standalone `server.js`. |
| RSC flight payload (`RSC: 1` → `text/x-component`) | ✅ | smoke b | Hard-asserts the React flight content-type. |
| Route handlers (App Router `app/api/*/route.ts`) | ✅ | smoke c, apps/file-manager/src/app/api/health/route.ts | Hard-asserts `GET /api/health` → 200 + valid JSON. |
| Dynamic routes (`force-dynamic`, per-request render) | ✅ | smoke d | Hard-asserts 200 on a `force-dynamic` route. |
| Static / prerendered routes (`force-static`) | ✅ | smoke e | Hard-asserts 200 on a `force-static` route. |
| Middleware (Node runtime, response header injection) | ✅ | smoke f, apps/file-manager/src/middleware.ts | Hard-asserts the middleware-injected `x-knext-smoke: 1` header. Node-runtime middleware only (see edge-middleware row). |
| Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM drain) | ✅ | packages/kn-next/src/adapters/shutdown.ts, packages/kn-next/src/__tests__/shutdown.test.ts | Unit-tested drain-on-SIGTERM in the standalone runtime. Not yet exercised end-to-end by `compat-smoke` (no SIGTERM-drain HTTP check in the as-built script). |
| ISR / Data Cache (Redis-backed cache handler) | ⚠️ | apps/file-manager/cache-handler.js, apps/file-manager/next.config.ts | Redis cache handler (`cacheHandler` in `next.config.ts`), **not** GCS. `compat-smoke` runs with `REDIS_URL=""` (in-memory fallback) and has **no revalidate/ISR-freshness assertion**, so ISR correctness is unverified by the gate. |
| `next/image` optimization (sharp, avif/webp) | ⚠️ | docs/adr/0006-image-optimization.md, apps/file-manager/next.config.ts, packages/kn-next/src/adapters/image-cache-sync.ts | Implementation landed (ADR-0006, sharp #43, scale-to-zero image cache sync #66). But `compat-smoke` check **(g) is skip-on-fail**, not a hard gate — a missing/failed optimizer downgrades to SKIP, so the matrix does not mark this ✅. |
| Server Actions (`'use server'` mutations) | ⚠️ | apps/file-manager/src/app/actions.ts | Server Actions exist in the app, but there is **no** `compat-smoke` or unit assertion exercising a Server Action round-trip. Configured, not verified. |
| Streaming / Suspense (incremental flush) | ❌ | — | No streaming/Suspense flush assertion in `compat-smoke` and no other evidence. Listed as a planned check in ADR-0007 but not built. |
| Edge Middleware (edge runtime) | ⛔ | docs/adr/0007-compat-suite.md | Upstream-gated: edge-runtime middleware is not yet adapter-standardizable on Knative; knext middleware runs on the Node runtime only. |
| PPR / Cache Components | ⛔ | docs/adr/0007-compat-suite.md | Upstream-gated: Partial Prerendering / Cache Components are not yet adapter-standardizable (CLAUDE.md §6, Tier C). |
| Official Next.js compatibility suite (deploy-test harness) | ✅ | .github/workflows/test-e2e-deploy.yml, test/deploy-tests-manifest.knext.json, docs/adr/0007-compat-suite.md | **GREEN — run 28702729595** (2026-07-04, `workflow_dispatch` on the #215 branch): **778 passed / 0 failed** across **16 shards** (0 notRun, 0 truncated), `vercel/next.js` **v16.2.0**, `NEXT_TEST_MODE=deploy`, Node runtime, driven by knext's `scripts/e2e-*.sh` lifecycle scripts + the `@knext/core` adapter tarball (totals summed from the run's 16 `compat-suite-summary-*.json` artifacts; 0 failed on every shard). 778 is the reproducible total under the current manifest — the ADR-0007 §d family selection. Historical graduation reference: run 28602886003 (2026-07-02, `main` @ `f247151`, 788 passed / 0 failed) — it **predates the §d selection** (its 788 included the family files that have since been file-level quarantined), so its total is not comparable to the current manifest. **What the claim covers:** Next's own deploy-eligible e2e set — the `test/deploy-tests-manifest.json` base selection mirrored at the pinned ref, including upstream's own per-case known-failing skips — minus (1) knext's **4 documented architectural exclusions** (`$knextExclusions` in [the manifest](../test/deploy-tests-manifest.knext.json): edge-runtime module errors, edge middleware, PPR, Cache Components — the ⛔ rows above) and (2) the **evidence-quarantined flaky ledger** (`$knextQuarantines` — each entry carries the observed run IDs, failure mechanism, and upstream provenance; guarded by `tests/deploy-manifest.test.ts`). The ledger is two-tier since #214 (ADR-0007 §d): per-case `suites` skips for isolated wobble, plus **file-level quarantines for the runtime-prefetch/navigation-timing family** — the 60s `individualTestTimeout` hangs whose root cause is upstream's client segment-cache race under CPU contention, **fixed upstream after the pinned ref** (vercel/next.js#95301; upstream itself suite-skipped five of these files as "too flaky" — one, cached-navigations, was later re-enabled by the #93798 revert, so its entry rests on the root cause + knext's own evidence). Family entries are bounded (≤15), carry `level:"file"` + full provenance, and expire on the first `NEXTJS_REF` containing the upstream fix. **What it does NOT cover:** the **Bun runtime axis** — this ✅ is the **Node** claim only; a separate Bun lane exists (see the Bun runtime-axis row below) but has **no green run yet** — and **long-run nightly stability** — the nightly record starts now (cron in the workflow). Revocation has teeth: a shard whose summary carries `failed>0` (or phantom `notRun>0`) **fails the job** (the "Fail shard on red results" gate), a failed scheduled run opens the pinned "Compat nightly RED" issue, and the policy is to flip this row back to ❌ citing the red run (the guard permits the flip-back freely). Graduation history (the multi-round path to green) is recorded in the ADR-0007 addenda. |
| Official suite — Bun runtime axis (`KNEXT_RUNTIME=bun`) | ❌ | — | **Lane exists, first green pending — remainder is PARTLY Bun-version-gated (canary-proven), partly open upstream gaps.** The compat workflow ([`test-e2e-deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/test-e2e-deploy.yml)) carries a separate Bun lane: a `workflow_dispatch` input (`runtime: bun`) and a **weekly Sunday schedule** (`17 5 * * 0`) plumb `KNEXT_RUNTIME=bun` into `scripts/e2e-deploy.sh`, which boots the standalone `server.js` on **bun** instead of node; every `compat-suite-summary-*.json` artifact carries `"runtime"` so results are lane-attributable, and a red bun weekly opens its own "Compat weekly RED (bun lane)" issue (never the Node credential's). A `bun-version` `workflow_dispatch` input (string, default `latest`; **dispatch-only** — the weekly schedule always runs `latest`) selects the Bun the lane installs (e.g. `canary`), and bun-lane artifacts additionally carry `"runtimeVersion"` — the **observed** `bun --version` — so a canary run's evidence is version-attributable (node artifacts are unchanged; the key is absent on the node lane). **Campaign state (#188, PR #189, three fix rounds on Bun 1.3.14):** 749→784 of 788 (95.1%→99.5%) — fixed knext-side: the keep-alive reset guard (`bun-keepalive-guard.cjs`, Bun ≤1.3.x resets reused sockets; verified fixed in Bun canary 1.4.0), the standalone bun-condition export heal (`standalone-bun-exports`, nft omits react-dom's `server.bun.js`), plus teardown server-log surfacing and bun-lane cache debug. The **3 remaining red files are documented Bun ≤1.3.14 runtime gaps with minimal repros** (edge-sandbox outbound `fetch()` never resolves: `middleware-fetches-with-any-http-method` + app-static's POST-fetch case; the instrumented not-found `invariant` class: `app-static`, `parallel-routes-root-param-dynamic-child`) — **canary proof (run 28622051531, observed Bun 1.4.0): the invariant class PARTIALLY clears (`parallel-routes-root-param-dynamic-child` green; `app-static` still red) and the edge-sandbox `fetch()` gap PERSISTS on 1.4.0** (not version-gated — needs the documented upstream report and/or a knext-side workaround), with one canary-only new red (`edge-compiler-can-import-blob-assets`) noted as pre-release noise. A stable Bun ≥1.4 bump helps but does not alone produce green. **Under the current §d manifest (778 tests), the most recent observed weekly result is 775 passed / 3 failed — run 28734528961 (2026-07-05, scheduled weekly, Bun latest; conclusion `failure` by the fail-on-red design) — the failures being exactly the 3 documented red files above.** (The 2026-07-12 weekly red was the #255/#256 packaging incident failing at Prepare — zero adapter signal, fixed by PR #266; the lane re-verifies on the next Sunday cron.) **No green `runtime=bun` run has been observed**, so this row stays ❌ — the Node ✅ above does NOT extend to Bun. Flipping to ✅ requires the same evidence contract as the Node row (run ID + pinned ref + a real all-green result) from a run whose lane was bun (guard-tested in `tests/compat-matrix.test.ts`). |

## Maintenance & honesty

- **Every ✅ is mechanically gated.** `tests/compat-matrix.test.ts` parses this table and fails if a
  ✅ row's Evidence does not resolve to a real on-disk file, a **hard** `compat-smoke` check id, or
  the `compat-smoke` CI job. For the **official-suite row** it additionally requires the ✅ to cite
  a workflow **run ID**, the **pinned `vercel/next.js` ref**, and an explicit **"N passed / 0
  failed"** result — an evidence-less flip fails CI. It also forbids citing the **skip-on-fail**
  `next/image` check (g) as proof of a ✅.
- **The `compat-smoke` caveats are load-bearing.** It runs with `REDIS_URL=""` (in-memory cache, not
  Redis) and treats `next/image` (check g) as **skip-on-fail**. That is exactly why ISR and image
  optimization are ⚠️, not ✅, even though both are implemented.
- **Promotion path to ✅ for the partials / gaps.** A ⚠️/❌ row may move to ✅ only when a **red-on-fail**
  check covers it — e.g. an ISR-revalidate assertion (with a real `REDIS_URL`), a hard (non-skip)
  `next/image` assertion, or a streaming-flush assertion. Note that a green official-suite run does
  **not** automatically promote a smoke-gated ⚠️ row: each row keeps its own named evidence.
- **The official-suite claim is scoped by its row.** The ✅ above means exactly what its Notes cell
  says — the deploy-eligible set minus the documented exclusions and the quarantine ledger, Node
  runtime, one observed green run on `main` (#89 wired the harness; #147 graduated it, ADR-0007).
  The claim stays honest only while the nightly stays green: a sustained red nightly must flip the
  row back (the guard permits an honest ❌ regression without ceremony) or annotate it. The
  quarantine + exclusion ledgers in `test/deploy-tests-manifest.knext.json` are the public
  scoreboard — shrinking them to zero is the standing goal (ADR-0007 A3-3).
- **Red-nightly procedure (mechanized, end to end).** Red **test results actually fail the
  workflow**: each shard's final "Fail shard on red results" gate exits 1 when its summary JSON
  carries `failed>0` or `notRun>0` (the run step's `|| true` only swallows the *step* exit so the
  `if: always()` summarize/upload ledger always emits — the *job* verdict is the gate's). A failed
  *scheduled* run then makes the `nightly-red-alert` job create-or-update a pinned **"Compat
  nightly RED"** issue carrying the run link (idempotent — one open alert issue, a comment per red
  night). Both links in the chain are guard-tested in `tests/compat-suite-workflow.test.ts`.
  Policy: the alert issue opens → triage the shard logs → if the red persists, **flip this row
  back to ❌ citing the red run**. The matrix guard enforces evidence only in the ✅ direction
  (evidence IFF ✅), so the honest flip-back is always free.
