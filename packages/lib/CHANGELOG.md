# @getknext/lib

## 0.4.0

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- bf03457: Version the three published packages in lockstep.
  
  `@getknext/core` depends on `@getknext/lib` and `@getknext/db`, so the three have always had to
  ship as a set — but that was a documented intention, and the tree had already drifted to three
  different numbers. They are now a Changesets `fixed` group, so every release moves all three to the
  same version, and a guard fails if they diverge or if a fourth publishable package appears.
  
  No API change. From this release on, pinning `@getknext/core@x.y.z` pins the whole set.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9810a00: feat(db): core `@getknext/db` data SDK — `getDb` + `getDbRO` (ADR-0021)

  Introduces `@getknext/db`, a thin drizzle-orm wrapper over the existing scale-to-zero
  Postgres pools. The core ships two explicit, never-auto-routed client accessors —
  `getDb()` (writer, `DATABASE_URL`, read-your-writes) and `getDbRO()` (reader,
  `DATABASE_URL_RO`, bounded-staleness ~9s, falls back to the writer with a one-time
  warning when unset) — plus the re-exported drizzle query surface (`eq`/`and`/`sql`/…).

  `@getknext/lib` gains a symmetric read-only pool (`getDbPoolRO` / `closeDbPoolRO`) over
  `DATABASE_URL_RO`, mirroring the writer pool's ADR-0019 contract and tunable via
  `DB_POOL_RO_*`. Schema primitives, extension helpers, and the migrate runner land in
  follow-up work (#239–#242).

### Patch Changes

- Re-release the full three-package set: `@getknext/db` joins the published packages
  (`@getknext/core` depends on it for `kn-next db migrate`), so all three bump
  together and ship as a set — publishing core without db breaks every consumer
  install with a 404 on the missing member.
